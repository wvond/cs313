After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://pacific-refuge-37041.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/wvond/cs313

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
All elements are functioning as far as the app goes.  The only part not quite finished is the assignments page isn't filled in yet but will be.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Calling php include to add different elements of the page was pretty cool.

6. What is the difference between an HTTP Get and Post? When should each be used?
get can be cached while post is never.  Post is more secure and should be used when more security is required.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I was trying to use bootstrap but it wouldn't work on my site so i had to scrap it and make my own which was very time 
consuming but it now works and looks good.  It has a cool header background which is above and beyond along with being 
responsive in the home page design.
